Android Fused Location Demo
===========================

This demo runs on Android's Fused Location Provider API:

https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderApi.html

With combined use of network cellular signals, WiFi signals, and GPS signals to approximate the user's 
location. Testing shows much improved approximation of locations with use of this API over the conventional
means.
